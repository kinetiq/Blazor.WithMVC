        under /Blazor/css/site.css, and that isn't where the file is. *@

    @* The ~/ (absolute path) is important. This script is still found at the root of our site,
        but if you don't add ~/, the browser will look under /Blazor/ because of the change we made
        to the <base> element above. *@
